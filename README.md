# Image Manipulation API

This Node.js API allows you to manipulate third-party images by performing tasks such as resizing, cropping, applying filters, rotating, and converting formats using the Sharp.js library.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone image-manipulation-api
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd image-manipulation-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```shell
   node index.js
   ```

   The API will start running on `http://localhost:4100`.

## Usage

The API provides a single endpoint at `/manipulate` that accepts various URL parameters to customize the image manipulation.

### API Endpoint

```
GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&width=<WIDTH>&height=<HEIGHT>&crop=<CROP>&bw=<BW>&format=<FORMAT>&filter=<FILTER>&rotate=<ROTATE>&watermark=<WATERMARK>
```

### URL Parameters

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| url        | The URL of the third-party image to be manipulated.                                              |
| width      | The desired width of the manipulated image.                                                     |
| height     | The desired height of the manipulated image.                                                    |
| crop       | Set to `true` if the image should be cropped to fit the specified dimensions.                    |
| bw         | Set to `true` if the output should be black and white.                                           |
| format     | The desired format of the manipulated image (e.g., `jpg`, `png`, `webp`).                        |
| filter     | The filter to be applied to the image.                                                          |
| rotate     | The rotation angle in degrees.                                                                  |
| watermark  | Set to `true` to add a watermark to the image.                                                  |

### Examples

1. Resize an image:

   ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&width=<WIDTH>&height=<HEIGHT>
   ```

2. Crop an image:

   ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&crop=true
   ```

3. Convert an image to black and white:

   ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&bw=true
   ```

4. Convert an image to a specific format:

   ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&format=<FORMAT>
   ```

5. Filter the image:
    ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&filter=<FILTER>
   ```

6. Rotate the image:

    ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&rotate=<ROTATE>
   ```

7. Watermark the image:

  ```
   GET /manipulate?url=<IMAGE_URL>&watermark=true
   ```

Remember to replace `<IMAGE_URL>`, `<WIDTH>`, `<HEIGHT>`, `<FORMAT>`, `<FILTER>`, and `<ROTATE>` with the actual values based on your requirements.

### Additional Information

- If an error occurs during image manipulation or if any required parameters are missing, the API will respond with an appropriate error message and status code.
- The API supports various image formats, including JPEG, PNG, and WebP.
- You can add your own code to the API to apply additional image manipulations, such as filters, rotations, or watermarks.

## Testing and Validation

To ensure the correctness and reliability of the codebase, thorough testing and validation are recommended. Test the API against different scenarios, such as varying input parameters, different image URLs, dimensions, and formats. Also, test edge cases, such as extremely large or small dimensions, unsupported image formats, or invalid URLs.

Validate that the image manipulation tasks are executed correctly and the API responds with the expected results.
